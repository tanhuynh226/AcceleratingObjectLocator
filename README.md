# AcceleratingObjectLocator - Structural Model
## Goal: Design a an accelerating object locator that implements the following equation:

#### Clock cycle calculations
Logical Component Delays:
*	State Register (StateReg): 4 ns from Clk to output, 1 ns setup time
*	8Ã—16 Register File (RegFile): 6 ns from input to output (reading), 6 ns from Clk to output (writing), 1 ns setup time (writing)
*	ALU (ALU): 12 ns from input to output
*	16-bit Shifter: 4 ns from input to output
*	2-to-1 Selector: 3 ns from input to output
*	16-bit Output Register (OutReg): 4 ns from Clk to output; 1 ns setup time
*	16-bit Three-state Buffer (ThreeStateBuff): 2 ns from input to output


Minimum clock cycle = StateReg + CombLogic[^1] + RegFile + ALU + Selector
Minimum clock cycle = (4 + 1) + 11 + (6 + 6 + 1) + 12 + 3 = 44 ns

[^1]: Combinational Logic Delay(CombLogic): 11 ns
